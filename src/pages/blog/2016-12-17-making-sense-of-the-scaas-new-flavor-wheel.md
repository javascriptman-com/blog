JavaScript is not that language where we have to spend months and months of following courses or reading books to build something tangible. JavaScript is fairly easy to learn and has tons of libraries and frameworks to further help you to work with JavaScript and make everything easier.

Not to mention that you can start studying and applying without having to download dedicated IDE to start using JavaScript, you can run JavaScript code right in your web browser in computer.

With javasScript alone, you can build complete application from backend to frontend, even including cross-platform mobile apps.
